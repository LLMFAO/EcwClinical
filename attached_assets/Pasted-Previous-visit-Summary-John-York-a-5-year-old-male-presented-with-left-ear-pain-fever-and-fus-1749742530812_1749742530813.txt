Previous visit Summary

John York, a 5-year-old male, presented with left ear pain, fever, and fussiness. Physical examination revealed a bulging, erythematous left tympanic membrane with effusion, consistent with acute otitis media. The right ear was normal. Amoxicillin was prescribed for 10 days, with instructions for pain management and follow-up in two weeks. The mother was educated on warning signs and when to seek further medical attention.

Chief Complaint
Two-week follow-up for left ear infection and right wrist pain after a fall.

History of Present Illness
John York, a 5-year-old male, presents for a two-week follow-up of his left ear infection. His mother reports that he completed the full course of amoxicillin without issues. Within two days of starting the medication, his fever resolved, ear pain subsided, and he returned to his normal self with improved appetite. He finished the last dose a few days ago and has been symptom-free since.

Two days ago, John fell from the monkey bars at the playground, landing on his outstretched right hand. He cried immediately after the fall and has been complaining of right wrist pain since. His mother notes that he's been favoring his left hand and that there's some swelling in the right wrist. She has been administering ibuprofen for pain relief.

Assessment + Plan
1. Resolved left otitis media:
   - Infection has cleared. Residual fluid behind eardrum is expected to resolve over time.
   - No further treatment needed for the ear at this time.

2. Right wrist fracture:
   - X-ray confirms a small buckle (torus) fracture on the right wrist.
   - Plan:
     a) Referral to Pediatric Orthopedics specialist sent.
     b) Orthopedics will likely replace temporary splint with a short arm cast.
     c) Continue ibuprofen for pain management as needed.
     d) Orthopedics will determine follow-up schedule and treatment duration.

Patient Instructions
1. Keep temporary splint on until seen by Orthopedics.
2. Continue ibuprofen for pain relief as needed.
3. Await call from Pediatric Orthopedics office for appointment scheduling (expected within 1-2 days).
4. Appointment with Orthopedics should occur within the next 1-2 days.
5. Avoid strenuous activities with the right arm until cleared by Orthopedics.
6. Return to clinic or seek immediate care if wrist pain worsens, or if any new symptoms develop.
